This project uses two datasets from the [Million Song Dataset](http://www.millionsongdataset.com):  
1) Million Song Dataset - a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks.
2) Taste Profile Subset - contains real user play counts from undisclosed partners, all songs already matched to the MSD.

**Note:** For initial experiments, the MillionSongSubset – a smaller subset of 10,000 songs – is used.
